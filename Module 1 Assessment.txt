User Stories
1. I am a working professional in the tech industry. I love automating and optimizing programs and workflows. I am looking for an app that can automate my lunch ordering without compromising my commitment to a healthy diet. I would also love to become aware of new places to order from in my area without having to search the internet.

2. I’m working from home as a technical writer. I can usually cook for myself, but sometimes I’m just not feeling it. I’m not too picky, so I’m looking mostly for highly-rated new restaurants for the special days I want to treat myself to a novel food experience.

3. I just got a new role as a marketing manager in the tech industry and I anticipate I’ll need to start ordering lunches for myself more frequently. I love most types of food, so I’m just looking for some cheap eats from a variety of local places on the days I’m more busy than normal.

4. I moved to America to start an authentic Thai Restaurant run by me and my family. We have a lot of details figured out but we are still considering our marketing strategy. We don’t want to spend too much money on broad advertisements, we’re really just looking to target and capture the loyalty of customers who already love Thai Food.

5. I am a franchisee of Wendy’s. We have been struggling against our competition with all of the new places that have been popping up and drawing attention. We planning to run some new promos that will hopefully shift a share of the market back in our direction.
